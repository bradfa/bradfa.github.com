A month ago, I <a href="http://bradfordembedded.blogspot.com/2010/11/being-clear-about-work-i-want-to-do.html">wrote a post</a> saying I want to be clear about the work I want to do and that I'd follow up every month or so.&nbsp; It's about that time.<br /><br />I'm doing something interesting.&nbsp; I'm learning.&nbsp; It's open source.&nbsp; There's, so far, no bureaucracy.<br />I'm not yet teaching and I'm still a long way off from making any money. <br /><br />I've started working on the <a href="http://trac.cross-lfs.org/">CLFS</a> (Cross Linux From Scratch) project.&nbsp; I've opened two tickets for changes that should be made to the embedded book and submitted patches.&nbsp; They're minor things, no one seems to have noticed yet, but I feel very proud of myself.<br /><br />I'm making progress and it feels really good.</div>
