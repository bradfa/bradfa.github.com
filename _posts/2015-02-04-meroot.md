I often dabble with cross compilers and building little embedded systems.  CLFS
[embedded book][clfsem] basically does this, but you end up with a system that can't
compile anything as it lacks a native compiler.  CLFS main book does this but
the resulting root file system is quite large and full of tools which you may
not really want.

I wanted to see if I could bootstrap together a root file system which was
capable enough to build itself again and to build software using [pkgsrc][pkgsrc].

So, I built [MeRoot][meroot].

It's definitely not perfect, but it's a nice start and I learned quite a bit.
