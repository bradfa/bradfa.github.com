I've been reading&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-GCC-GNU-Compilers/dp/0954161793?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bradford07-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">An Introduction to GCC: For the GNU Compilers GCC and G++</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bradford07-20&amp;l=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=0954161793" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important; padding: 0px ! important;" width="1" /> (also available <a href="http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/gccintro/">online for free</a>, from the publisher).&nbsp; I'm not that experienced with GCC and there's a lot of good information in this book.&nbsp; It's a little out dated but I believe most still applies to today's versions of GCC.<br /><br />One part of the book discusses libraries.&nbsp; I've not really had any experience with libraries and they always seemed to mystify me.&nbsp; I found this quote to really clear one part of that up:<br /><br />"<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">External libraries are usually provided in two forms: static libraries and shared libraries. Static libraries are the ‘.a’ files seen earlier. When a program is linked against a static library, the machine code from the object files for any external functions used by the program is copied from the library into the final executable.</span></span><br /><div style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Shared libraries are handled with a more advanced form of linking, which makes the executable file smaller. They use the extension ‘.so’, which stands for shared object.</span></span>"<br /><br />It's simple, straight forward, and now that I understand, I feel silly for previously not understanding libraries.&nbsp; And besides that, the discussion about LD_LIBRARY_PATH (loader library path) and LIBRARY_PATH (linker library path) is very helpful.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/gccintro/gccintro_23.html">Section 3.1.2</a> starts a very good explanation.</div>
