I'm a [Fastmail][1] subscriber.  It's my main email account and is where my
@bradfordembedded.com email is hosted.

High quality email is a very valuable thing.  You won't realize it until you
have an email provider that sucks.  Fastmail doesn't suck.  In fact, they
"don't suck" so much that I give them $40 per year for an "Enhanced" account.

Their servers are super responsive and round trip time from my work computer
to them is under 20ms.  To put that in perspective, Google's local servers are
only about 1ms lower in latency.  Fastmail cares about having responsive 
servers, they have chosen [NYI][2] for either colo or dedicated server hosting,
which has awesome connectivity.

Fastmail is awesome!

I used to use Gmail.  I liked Gmail.  Over time, especially the past year, I've
grown less fond of Google.  I'm concerned over the amount of information that
Google keeps about me, I'm concerned over the way Google manages the Android
ecosystem, and Google is now a high value target for scammers and phishers
(by the way, I'm not sure how fond Phish, the band, is of that spelling, but
they do make some great music).

But Gmail's IMAP sometimes sucks.  Google isn't very responsive to small
customer needs.  And Google has millions of "free" subscribers.  If I complain,
Google doesn't listen.

Fastmail's IMAP hasn't sucked, in fact, it's wicked fast.  Fastmail replies to
my questions.  Fastmail has fewer subscribers than Google, but many of them pay
for the service, which means there's incentive to keep them happy.  Plus, I
don't see ads, I'm not worried Fastmail is selling my info, and I like
supporting smaller companies (Fastmail is now owned by Opera, the people who
make the Opera browser).

Gmail isn't horrible but it's not great either.  Fastmail is better.

But if you'd like to see horrible email hosting in operation, subscribe to
AppRiver.  No, I'm not going to link to them.  They don't deserve it.

We have Exchange hosting by AppRiver at work.  I don't use Exchange.  I hate
Exchange.  But that's OK, because Exchange supports IMAP.  Except AppRiver
seems to oversubscribe so badly that my work email IMAP takes orders of
magnitude longer to do anything than my Fastmail.  And I have / get way less
email on my work account than on my personal account (I subscribe to a few
different linux- mailing lists on my personal account, to say the least,
they're high volume!).

Spam filtering: Fastmail errs on the side of letting a few spams through.
Google errs on the side of marking some ham as spam.  AppRiver thinks anything
with the word "Linux" in it is spam.  Yes, AppRiver is really that bad.

In conclusion:

* Good email is hard to come by but once you experience it, you won't ever want
anything less.
* [Fastmail][1] is awesome.
* Gmail sucks, but not horribly.  For free email it's not a bad choice.
* AppRiver is horrible.  Please don't give these people money.
