Sometimes I have a hard time getting around procrastination.  I don't think
I'm alone in this.

I've been listening to Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin's podcast [Back to Work][1]
lately and procrastination is one thing they address multiple times.
Merlin is of the opinion that procrastination partly stems from having
an item on your to-do list but not having a defined set of steps spelled out
yet (in your head, on paper, whatever) for how to accomplish the task.
You may not even know what the next thing you have to do in order to accomplish
the task is.

**So make a freaking list of actions!**

The items on the list should be actions.  Verbs.  Things like:

1. *Drive* to the mall
2. *Walk* to shoe store
3. *Try* on 5 pairs of running shoes in size 12
4. *Select* 1 pair that fits the best
5. *Pay* for shoes
6. *Drive* home

or

1. *Launch* web browser
2. *Navigate* to Zappos
3. *Locate* 5 pairs of running shoes in size 12
4. *Pay* for shoes
5. *Try* on all 5 pairs
6. *Select* 1 pair that fits the best
7. *Request* to return other 4 to Zappos
8. *Pack* 4 pairs of shoes into box
9. *Print* return shipping label
10. *Apply* shipping label
11. *Drive* box to UPS store
12. *Leave* box at UPS store
13. *Drive* home

All the italic words are verbs.  Now you have a list.  This makes buying shoes
brain dead simple.  Execute the list, check off each step.  Now you have
no reason for not buying shoes, unless...

If buying shoes is really that important to you, execute the list.  If buying
shoes isn't that important, **WHY THE HELL IS IT ON YOUR LIST?!?!**

Buying shoes doesn't sound like a big deal.  But I've had "buy new shoes" on my
to-do list for at least 2 years.  It's clearly not that important to me.

**Time to either execute or remove it from my list!**

(Yes, this also relates to [Planning, Specifying and Documenting][2] work
projects.  No one at big companies likes doing their work, that's why they
write big lists of actions that have to happen.  You should, too.)
