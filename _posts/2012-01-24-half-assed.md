If you're going to do things half assed, don't do them.

Half assed things annoy people.

Don't confuse minimum viable products (MVPs) with doing things half
assed.  MVPs are high quality but feature reduced.  What they do, they do well.
MVPs make it clear why they don't do the things they don't do.  Half assed makes
it clear what they want to do but then doesn't follow through with any kind of
quality.
