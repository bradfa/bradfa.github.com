This morning, I found this <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2009/02/need-to-find-a-job-stop-lookin.html">article from the Harvard Business Review</a> blog that's mostly about job hunting but also a few other things.  Do what you enjoy, build relationships, and stop stressing out about the state of the economy or your life.  You'll find what you are looking for faster, or at least enjoy yourself way more while waiting for opportunity to arrive in the same amount of time.<br /><br />I like the premise.  It's part of why I started contributing to the Cross Linux From Scratch project and why I started blogging.  My database class notes blog might make me a little money from Google ads but I think the real value is in establishing myself as a resource and opening doors for me.  Maybe (but probably not) I'll become a lesser version of Salman Khan and be known for presenting small chunks of learning.  Who knows?!  Certainly not me, but I am enjoying writing more.<br /><br />In mostly the same vein, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/09/26/gruber-merlin-sxsw-2009">Marco</a> linked to <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2009/03/25/blogs-turbocharged">a presentation</a> by John Gruber and Merlin Mann from SXSW 2009 that I really enjoy listening to.  The title of their talk is awesome, "HOWTO: 149 Surprising Ways to Turbocharge Your Blog With Credibility!"  (note: you will not hear them list 149 things, it's more like 5)</div>
