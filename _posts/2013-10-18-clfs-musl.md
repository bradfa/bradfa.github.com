This week the CLFS embedded book switched from uClibc to musl for its C library.

Some people really like musl as it's license is MIT rather than GPL.  I think
that's nice and all, but license compliance if you're using Linux already isn't
that big of a deal.  You're already jumping through hoops, adding one more
package that probably won't be customized in use is almost 0 additional work.

The real reason for the switch is I hate manually configuring things.  uClibc is
great, so long as you don't mind wading through a huge configuration.  The
defconfig isn't sane for most architectures I care about.  musl doesn't have any
configuration, unless you really really want to.  This is very important to me
as trying to explain how to create a sane uClibc configuration for more than one
architecture, or trying to make a bunch of patches supplying uClibc
configurations, is quite painful.

musl requires an MMU.  uClibc doesn't.  For my own sanity, this is generally a
good thing.

As another related note, I've also made a bunch of other updates to the embedded
CLFS book recently and it's getting closer to a set of exact steps that actually
works!  The next big change will be cleaning up the kernel and bootloader
instructions.
