I've been listening to Marco Arment and Dan Benjamin's 5by5 podcast, [Build 
and Analyze][1] while driving for the past few days on the new iPod Touch
that I got for Father's Day (thanks wife and daughter! :)

There seems to be quite a focus on coffee and Marco seems like a coffee snob.
I say that with the utmost respect.

I'm not a coffee snob.  I only started regularly drinking coffee about 1 year
ago around the time my daughter was born.

At Xerox, there was horrible coffee
so I brought in a small 1 cup maker I had gotten for Christmas a few years back
and made my one cup of not-horrible coffee from pre-ground beans each morning
and added the requisite non-dairy powder creamer and sugar.  Now, at my new
job, we have a "plastic pile of crap" Keurig machine, so I no longer need
to clean out anything after making a cup (nor do I have to pay for coffee in
any way, which is handy) but I was still drinking just 1 cup in the morning
(with an occasional decaf cup in the afternoon) and adding creamer and sugar.

Marco espouses the merits of black coffee, that it is better in every way.
So, this morning, I decided to try it.  Yes, from the "plastic pile of crap"
Keurig, and using a k-cup, but it's actually pretty good.  I'm surprised.

One of the things holding me back from getting a decent insulated mug was that
adding cream and sugar to coffee means I'd have to rigorously clean the mug
in order to keep things from growing in it.  But, if I drink black coffee,
that's less of a concern.  **Plus! Less calories!** (if that matters.)

So now I'm contemplating an [Aeropress][2] and a [burr grinder][3].  I don't
think I'll buy one, quite yet, but the will be added to my wish list.  I guess
it's time to try some "real coffee"...
