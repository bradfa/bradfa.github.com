<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5712785/">Gawker got hacked</a> over the weekend and had all their users' data stolen, including encrypted passwords.&nbsp; Awesome.<br /><br />Gawker at least emailed all the people who had accounts letting them know that this happened, which is nice of them.&nbsp; I didn't even realize I had a Gawker account, but I do.&nbsp; I've changed my password there as well as my Google and Amazon passwords.&nbsp; I don't have any idea what password I used for Gawker but figure I should be cautious since I did use my real Gmail address for the Gawker account.&nbsp; All my banking stuff uses usernames and passwords I don't use anywhere else so I'm not concerned about those.<br /><br />I'm thoroughly annoyed by this.&nbsp; Generally I don't like getting accounts at tons of websites, mostly because I don't want to remember all the logins.&nbsp; On my work laptop I use <a href="http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/">Password Safe</a> so I don't have to remember any passwords or usernames, but I shouldn't have to.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.quora.com/What-s-wrong-with-OpenID">OpenID isn't the answer</a>.&nbsp; I don't have the ability to easily generate throw away email addresses (right now).&nbsp; Using <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html">Gmail's "+" option</a> doesn't work on 90% of the sites I've tried.&nbsp; So far, just not having accounts is the only answer.&nbsp; But not having accounts is actually fairly difficult these days.<br /><br />I'm thoroughly annoyed and I don't know how to fix this.</div>
