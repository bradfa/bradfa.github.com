I started drinking coffee regularly about a year ago, when my daughter was
born.  I drink 1 cup each morning, when I get to the office.

I always added cream and sugar, one of each when they came in standard
packet sizes. But last week, I started drinking coffee black.

Oh. My. God.

That cream and sugar really covers up a lot of the variation
in coffee taste.  Some coffee is downright horrible tasting, some has almost
no taste at all, and some is good tasting.  Drinking it black has helped me
realize this.

Folgers sucks.  It's bitter, then has no taste.  Why is it one of the most
popular coffees?  Marco and Dan talk a little (a lot?) about coffee in
[Build and Analyze #10][1] and why people seem to keep buying the horrible
kinds.

At work, we have a [$200+ abomination of ridiculously chromed plastic
festooned with blue LEDs][2].  Usually we stock the [Columbian][3].
It's actually pretty decent tasting, much much better than the decaf or
Folgers stuff.  The [decaf][4] sucks, it just tastes like burnt.

Now, I'm becoming a coffee snob.  I'm not a full-on snob, I still think that
the Keurig makes an OK cup of the Columbian, but an [AeroPress][6] is now on
[my Amazon Christmas wish list][8].

If anyone wants to buy me a [Tonx subscription][7], I'd be more than happy
to drink all of it!
