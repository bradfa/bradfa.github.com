That's the **wrong kind of job security**.  If what you consider job security
is the ability to keep your current job, you're doing it wrong.

Lots of people at large companies have this mentality about job security.  They
view layoffs and the potential of losing their jobs as a very big deal.  Now,
I'm not saying it's not some kind of deal, it's just not that big of a deal,
**if** you've been building a career and not just working to *keep* a job.
There's a huge difference between building a career and keeping a job.

Building a career means always learning.  It means minimizing the time spent
doing things you've done before, automating them away if possible.  It means
always signing up for things that you don't feel comfortable with.  It means
doing **a lot of reading**.  It means asking stupid questions of smart people,
being told that you're asking stupid questions, and getting pointed in the right
direction.  Then working your butt off.

Building a career means not standing still.  It means moving with the flows of
new technology, of new practices, of new techniques.  It means always increasing
your efficiency.

Working a job means doing just enough to not get fired.

I love the movie [Office Space][1].  But I want to be building a career, not working a
job.  I'm not Peter, as much as I may have dreamed of acting like him when I
was at Xerox.

In the past, I had wasted time and brain power worrying about keeping a job.
That's stupid.  Instead, I should have been building a career.

**Now, I am.**
