I'm now working at my second "real job."  The two environments are very different but I've grown to appreciate a few office things:<br /><br /><ul><li>Free decent coffee</li><li>A small kitchen area</li><li>Offices with walls and doors, just like in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633439/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bradford07-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0932633439">Peopleware</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bradford07-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0932633439" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></li><li>Startups don't have open office environments because they like them, real estate and renovations are a pain and that effort would be better put to making product</li><li>Parking shouldn't require a 10 minute walk, in the cold, in Rochester</li><li>No one should be using a monitor smaller than 24 inches</li><li>Laptops, get them</li><li>Solid State Disks, get them for the laptops</li><li>Wifi, gotta have</li><li>Fast, symmetric net connection for the office, at least 10/10 Mbit for a few people, more for more</li><li>Don't block any of the web.  Trust your employees not to surf porn at work and they won't.</li><li>Big desks with lots of space are very handy, reduces the need for lab time with hardware</li><li>GOOD CHAIRS! They don't have to be Aerons (my present chair leaves something to be desired)</li><li>Open 24/7 for use</li></ul></div>
