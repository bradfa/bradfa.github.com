I've been having conversations with various different people over the past few months about the state of America: our education system, economy, corporations, tax law, and politics.&nbsp; One trend I'm seeing from the people I have conversations with (and both on TV and online articles) is that people are very pessimistic.<br /><br />I'm not pessimistic.&nbsp; I'm very optimistic.<br /><br />Maybe we don't have the highest ranking education system.&nbsp; Maybe we're outsourcing a lot of jobs to India and China.&nbsp; Maybe our political system is fractured and uncooperative.&nbsp; Maybe all this is true.<br /><br />But you know what?&nbsp; Everyone outside North America, even if only slightly, is envious of us.&nbsp; Maybe they're not envious of <b>all</b> our things, but we have something that's better, worth being envious of.<br /><br />We have the best sports leagues (NHL, NFL, MLB, NBA, and PGA).&nbsp; We have THE financial market (Wall St.).&nbsp; We have the best higher education system (everyone knows Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Yale, heck even my alma mater RPI).&nbsp; We have the biggest, most high tech companies (Google, Facebook, IBM, Apple, and Intel).<br /><br />Almost all of these things that we have, that are the best, are spreading world wide.&nbsp; It's a global economy and in order to grow, it's required.&nbsp; But they all started here and for the most part are based here, in the USA.<br /><br />This is the reason so many people still flock to the US.&nbsp; We're still the land of opportunity, of the free, and where dreams can come true.&nbsp; It's why we have an illegal immigrant "problem."&nbsp; So many people want so badly to come here that they're willing to break the law, hide, and do jobs for very little pay with horrid work conditions.<br /><br />Stop being pessimistic.&nbsp; It'll only hold you back from greatness, especially in America.</div>
