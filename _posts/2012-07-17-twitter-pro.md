Seth Godin [commented on AVC][1] in response to [In Defense of Free][2] mentioning
Twitter, and that if they had a Twitter Pro account for $2 / month, that it
could generate upwards of $240 million per year for 10 million subscribers.

That's the idea behind the [Freemium][3] business model.  And it's a really
good one.  Especially for Twitter's situation.

Make there be a Pro account, don't show Pro's any promoted content, allow any
and all API access, and give them other tools to curate their Twitter use.

I can't see how this would be a bad thing.  I'm not sure that 10 million users
would want to sign up for it, but I'd bet tens of thousands would.  It may not
be the revenue leader for the company, but I think it would pay for itself.
And if $2 / month isn't enough, have tiers with different prices where each
tier gets certain other abilities.

Then Twitter could cut off API access for everyone except "official" apps and
the web interface.  Free users would be forced to experience Twitter the way
Twitter wants but those that pay could experience it any way they please.
Twitter can do this, they already have an established service, they'd still be
offering a free version, and those that whine and complain about the change
could make all their own misery go away for just a few bucks per month.

No downside.

I wonder how many people at Twitter had even considered this before Seth said
it...

It'd be just like LinkedIn and the fact that everybody in marketing, sales, and
recruiting pays for a more advanced LinkedIn account.  The free service
specifically doesn't have certain features and the paid accounts are reasonably
priced.  Bam!  Profit. (or at least revenues)
