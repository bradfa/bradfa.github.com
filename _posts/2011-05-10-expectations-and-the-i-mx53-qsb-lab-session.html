My expectations were high for the Freescale i.MX53 lab session that was held this morning.  I was excited!  The agenda had items like Linux on the i.MX53! LTIB! Android development on the i.MX53! and free lunch!<br /><br />My expectations were not realized.<br />There was free lunch but I left.<br /><br />The morning consisted of a lecture by a very nice and smart guy about general embedded Linux things and the i.MX53 QSB hardware.  No fault on him but the material was way too basic.  I was expecting to get right into using LTIB and learning about the LTIB configuration and build system and how it applies to the i.MX53.  I don't have much experience with LTIB but we didn't really do much with it other than run a script and look at some options in the menuconfig interface.<br /><br />Those who felt comfortable with embedded Linux were given the serial cables and SDcards so they could play during the lecture.  I tried to do the Ubuntu demo but just loading it onto the SDcard must have taken a good hour.  Then the USB to serial converter decided to not play nice with VMware Workstation (host machines were Ubuntu 10.10 in a VM on top of Windows).  And then once the demo finished loading and I booted it... It's Ubuntu! What's the fun of that?  What did I learn?  Nothing.<br /><br />SDcards are slow.  But that's another topic all together.<br /><br />I then played a little with LTIB but I didn't like it.  I felt like I had no control over the choices.  I'm not sure if that is LTIB's fault or Freescale's fault.  We didn't have a connection to the Internet so there was no way for me to use any sources other than what was provided.  Regardless, it was a type the following few lines, look at some options that have already been selected, push go.  One thing I really disliked was that the LTIB menuconfig had almost no help for options that were vague.  That's not cool.<br /><br />I did meet a nice guy name Jon who works for a local company doing board support packages for custom embedded boards, that was cool.  But overall, I wish I hadn't gone.  It was nice out today so I did the next best thing and left at lunch to mow the lawn.  Way better use of my vacation day.</div>
