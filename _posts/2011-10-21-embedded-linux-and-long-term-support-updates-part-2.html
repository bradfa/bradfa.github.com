In my <a href="http://bradfordembedded.blogspot.com/2011/10/embedded-linux-and-long-term-support.html">previous post</a> about embedded Linux long term support, I neglected Ubuntu.  I had not realized how much effort Canonical are putting into their ARM platform products.  After doing a little reading today, it appears that within the next year, Ubuntu's long term support server distribution should be a very high quality product on ARM platforms.  That's awesome!<br /><br />Ubuntu LTS server releases are already supported for 5 years.  Starting with version 12.04, the desktop LTS release will also be <a href="http://www.canonical.com/content/ubuntu-1204-feature-extended-support-period-desktop-users">supported for 5 years</a>.  Combined with<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/OMAP"> prebuilt images</a> for various ARM development kits, that's an awesome starting point for higher powered, ARM based, embedded systems.<br /><br />Ubuntu seems primed to completely take over the Linux distro landscape.  I think that's awesome if you're looking to develop any new Linux based device on a platform they support.  It'll make your life that much easier.  Thanks, Canonical!</div>
