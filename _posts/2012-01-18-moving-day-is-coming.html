<div class='post'>
<p>Shortly, Bradford Embedded will be moving away from Blogger!</p>
<p>The exact timing isn't set yet but I will be sure to post the new home prominently when it happens.  I'm moving to a Jekyll generated blog hosted on GitHub pages.  The goal is to have the transition go as smoothly as possible, so I'm taking it slow.  Until I've fully switched over, all posts will show up on both platforms.</p>
<p>To see my progress - and the full archive of posts imported from Blogger - head on over to the new <a href="http://www.bradfordembedded.com">BradfordEmbedded.com</a>.</p>
