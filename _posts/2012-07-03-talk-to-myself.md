I like to talk to myself.

Maybe I'm crazy.  I don't know.

But I find it easier to put pieces of new concepts together when I'm able to
talk to myself out loud.  When I'm programming or conceptualizing ideas,
talking out loud makes things flow easier for me.

It's hard to talk to myself, out loud, in an open office or cube farm.  Mostly
because I don't want to disturb everyone else (nor do I want them to talk
out loud and disturb me) but also because I don't want everyone to think I'm
the crazy guy who talks to himself.

It feels less like I'm a crazy person when I write about the fact that I talk to myself
on the Internet rather than when I say it to someone in person.  Thanks, Internet.
