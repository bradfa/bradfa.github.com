I'm writing a book about embedded Linux but I'm not going to compete with traditional technical books.&nbsp; O'Reilly isn't my competition.&nbsp; (I personally really like many O'Reilly books and how they're often they're written by open source contributors.)<br /><br />My competition is often outdated and unfriendly, hard to <u><b>use</b></u> technical resources such as the web, mailing lists, wikis, forums, and yes, books.<br /><br />I want to teach people how to develop embedded Linux systems.&nbsp; I don't want to provide a step by step here's <u><b>how</b></u> you put together an embedded Linux system, although I'm going to do that.&nbsp; I want to provide the how, but right behind that I'm going to provide the <b><u>why</u></b>.<br /><br />Why does the manual tell me to do this step and then that step?&nbsp; What's going on under the covers?&nbsp; What if I (the reader) want to do something similar to this but changing things X, Y, and Z?<br /><br />I'm going to answer those questions.&nbsp; You (the reader) are going to help me.<br /><br />The book's going to be inexpensive (not free).&nbsp; There's going to be online collaboration (think Google Groups or a forum).&nbsp; The book's going to take on the mantra of release early, release often.&nbsp; Trees are going to die, but the book will be available in electronic formats too.<br /><br />I think it's going to be amazing!&nbsp; I hope you will, too.</div>
