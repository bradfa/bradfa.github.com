The Stanford online database course's <a href="http://db-class.org">enrollment has opened</a> and I've got my <a href="http://db-class-notes.blogspot.com/">course notes blog</a> started!<br /><br />I'll be blogging my notes and thoughts on the course in as close to real time as I can.  I hope to post up my solutions to assignments once allowed on <a href="https://github.com/bradfa">my Github</a> account.</div>
