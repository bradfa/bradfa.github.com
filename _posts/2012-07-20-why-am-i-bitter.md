Why am I bitter right now?

I don't know.  Maybe I'm unmotivated.

So, why am I both unmotivated and bitter?

I feel like I have no control over the outcome of the company.

Why don't I feel like I have control?

It seems like my performance isn't in any way influencing the success of the
company.

Why would I feel that my performance isn't influencing the success of the
company?

I've been here for almost 9 months and nothing I've created has ever seen a
customer use it.  I don't know that what I'm creating will even be what the
customers want.

Why don't I know if what I'm building is what the customers want?

Because we've not put anything like it in front of them.  And the things we have
put in front of customers hasn't caused anyone to really really want to give us
money.  We're building for an imaginary customer, the ideal customer, but we
don't know if that customer, or anyone even remotely like them, even exists.
And if they do exist, are they really willing to pay for what we're creating?  I
don't know.

So, I'm bitter and unmotivated because I feel that the work I'm doing could be all for
naught.  That the customers may not even want what I'm spending quite a lot of
time and effort creating.  That, even with my time and effort, what I'm making
doesn't solve a problem worth solving.

That's a shitty situation.

But, hey! I got to use 5 whys and learn something about why I feel the way I do.
And I made the clackity noise.  Funny how that works.

Funny thing how writing something no one else will ever see can make you have
feelings and think.  Then again, maybe it'd be good if some other people saw
this...
