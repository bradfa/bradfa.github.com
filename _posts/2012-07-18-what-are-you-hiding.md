Are you the guy who has an answer to every question?  Are you the guy who always
prefaces a piece of advice with, "When I was at..."?  Are you the guy who will
get into a screaming match rather than look wrong?

Don't be that guy.  That guy's hiding something.  That guy's afraid people will
find something out about him.  The thing people might find out, it's not really
that big of a deal, but that guy thinks it is.

Also, no one likes that guy.  No one wants to work with that guy.  And especially, no
one wants to **work for** that guy.

If you're that guy, say "I don't know."  Say "I'm wrong."  Stop telling war stories 10 times a day.
Just try it, if even only for 1 day.  You'll live.  And people might like you
better.  We know you're reasonably smart, that's why you're here.
If you weren't reasonably smart, you'd
have been fired or laid off by now.  But we also know you're not **real smart**,
because if you were, you wouldn't still be here on your own volition.

***So, shut up and get back to work.***

Or, go work at a big company, there's lots of **that guy**s there.
