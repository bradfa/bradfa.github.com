<div class='post'>
Some things I'd like to do next:<br /><br /><ol><li>Compile a spreadsheet of all the major parts on the BeagleBoard-xM with links to the part product page and datasheet.</li><li>Understand why the $BUILD variable gets set to the -mabi= option in CLFS embedded section 6.3 and what the impact of this is.&nbsp; Should it get set when building GCC rather than for each package?&nbsp; See <a href="http://trac.cross-lfs.org/ticket/620">trac ticket 620</a>.</li><li>Set up a git repo locally and follow the CLFS embedded book within the repo to enable me to better react to and understand changes.&nbsp; In this way, if some part of the book changes, I can go back to a tag just before the change and then be able to tell what the change has done.&nbsp; I'll also be able to get a better idea of what files get put in what places as parts of the CLFS embedded book don't have good info on this.</li></ol></div>
