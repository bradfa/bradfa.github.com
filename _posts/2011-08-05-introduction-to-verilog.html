I found a nice series of lectures given at the Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur by Prof. Sengupta.  They're hosted on YouTube and I've made a playlist for lectures 2 through 7.  There are quite a few lectures in this course and I'll be posting playlists for more later.  <br /><br />Please be aware, at the start of each lecture video there is a very loud test tone for the first few seconds.<br /><br /><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/p/522694885E653BC7?version=3&hl=en_US&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/p/522694885E653BC7?version=3&hl=en_US&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
