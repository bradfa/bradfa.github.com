Ted Dziuba inspired me to try installing <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2011/01/multiple-concurrent-linux-distros.html">multiple concurrent Linux distributions</a> inside of an existing distribution. &nbsp;This is really handy for testing. &nbsp;Go try it (it won't take long). &nbsp;It's really awesome!<br /><br />Ted's instructions are rather minimal, although are a great place to start. &nbsp;I also found the&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap">Debian Wiki - Debootstrap</a>&nbsp;page to be helpful.<br /><br />In my case, I'm running Debian 6 squeeze on my desktop machine. &nbsp;I've installed Debian 5 lenny and Ubuntu 10.04 lucid as chroot environments. &nbsp;If after installing a Debian release, when running apt, you get errors about not being able to authenticate packages, make sure you run "apt-get update" first. &nbsp;That will take care of it.<br /><br />There's no "debian-minimal" package like there is for Ubuntu but (as root in the chroot environment) a quick "apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install aptitude sudo nano" got me to a place where installing the things I want is easy.<br /><br />One thing to be careful of, your user is still your user inside the chroot environment and your home directory is still your home directory! &nbsp;If you delete stuff in your home directory, it really will be gone, whereas if you delete / modify stuff (inside the chroot) from /etc and other system directories, it's only within the chroot.<br /><br />If you'd like to use rinse to install RedHat based distributions that aren't included by default (no recent Fedoras are for Debian 6's version of rinse), take a look at&nbsp;the <a href="http://gitorious.org/rinse/rinse/trees/master">rinse Gitorious tree</a> and grab the more up-to-date /etc/rinse/rinse.conf and *.packages files. &nbsp;I'll be doing this shortly and I'll post a follow up after installing some RedHat distros.<br /><br />See after the jump for list of commands I used to install both lenny and lucid...<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>sudo mkdir -pv /opt/chroot/lenny<br />sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd --arch amd64 \<br />&nbsp;lenny /opt/chroot/lenny/ http://mirror.rit.edu/debian/<br />sudo mkdir -p /opt/chroot/lucid<br />sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd --arch amd64 \<br />&nbsp;lucid /opt/chroot/lucid http://mirror.rit.edu/ubuntu/</div>

For Ubuntu lucid, when in the chroot, you may get some errors when running apt (or other programs).  They&#39;ll look like this: &quot;start: Unable to connect to Upstart: Failed to connect to socket /com/ubuntu/upstart: Connection refused&quot;<br /><br />To fix these issues with upstart (which are only evident in the chroot), check out this bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/+source/upstart/+bug/430224</div>

If you use the Gitorious /etc/rinse/*.packages files to install Fedora 13, just be forewarned that you may have an issue when attempting to run yum.  The issue will be the errror: &quot;Error: Cannot retrieve repository metadata (repomd.xml) for repository: fedora&quot;<br /><br />In the /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora{,-updates}.repo files, simply comment out the mirrorlist line and put your favorite local Fedora mirror in for baseurl (with the actual path).  This will make yum happy.</div>
