2 <a href="http://beagleboard.org/bone">BeagleBones</a> were delivered by the friendly people at FedEx this morning!<br /><br />I've got one of them booted up with the provided microSD card that came already inserted into the Bone.  Oddly, there's another microSD card that was included in a separate packaging inside the BeagleBone box.  I'm not yet sure what the difference is or why 2 were included, but both Bones came this way.<br /><br />FedEx also delivered a pair of new SanDisk Mobile Ultra 8GB microSD cards this morning.  I've run flashbench on them and <a href="http://lists.linaro.org/pipermail/flashbench-results/2011-December/000240.html">mailed in my results</a>.  These look like pretty nice cards for Linux given my understanding.<br /><br />Next up is building x-loader, u-boot, a kernel, and an Emdebian image for a Bone.<br /><br />EDIT 20111201 4:30pm: On my machine, the FTDI serial port driver wasn't working without some help and being that I'm an engineer, I didn't read the directions :)<br />There's good info on making sure your virtual serial port is working on the <a href="http://beagleboard.org/static/beaglebone/a3/README.htm">BeagleBone info page</a>.</div>
