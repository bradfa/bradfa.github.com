Here are some things I want to learn more about:

* The Linux kernel
* Microprocessors: ARM, MIPS, x86, and OpenRISC
* Ruby and Rails
* git
* Flash memory. Mainstream use is approaching fast.
* Compilers and software build tools

And some things I want to start learning about:

* Heroku, EC2 / AWS, Engine Yard, or some other cloud technology.
* Networking. IPv6 isn't a big deal yet but it will be eventually.
* Verilog / VHDL. I've done a tiny bit but I won't be contributing to
[OpenCores][1] any time soon.
* JavaScript and AJAX. The interactive web is a big deal.
