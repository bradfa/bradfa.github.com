<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

Probably overheard at Microsoft during Windows 7 development due to security issues Microsoft has experienced in the past, "I've got an awesome idea for updates!"<br /><br />That exclamation was probably quickly followed by, "Let's have Windows 7 <b>default</b> to automatically downloading any new updates over the internet and applying those updates in the middle of the night!  It can even <b>reboot, without prompting or authorization</b>, if a reboot is needed!"  And the Land of Microsoft rejoiced.<br /><br />Then users who don't expect their machine to reboot at 3am arrive at work and their computer has decided to reboot, possibly losing work, and at the very least moving windows, forgetting current location in very long Word documents, and generally making the user feel like they've lost control.<br /><br />So: Fuck You, Windows.  Your shit stinks.<br /><br />Side note: I don't mean to offend with my profanity.  The title is literally what came out of my mouth when I arrived at work this morning and my Windows 7 VM had decided to reboot on its own.</div>
