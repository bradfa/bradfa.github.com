When something disappointing happens, there's 2 ways to deal with it that I've
seen.  One's successful in getting people motivated in solving the problem or
making it not happen again, while the other does the exact opposite.

The first involves not placing blame, taking ownership of solving the problem,
and rallying.  The second involves expressing disappointment, directly or
indirectly placing blame, and not taking ownership.  If you're a leader and
you're doing the first method, good job!

If you're a leader and you're doing the second method, no one's going to tell
you.  You're not going to learn that you're doing it wrong.  You're just going
to alienate your people and build dissent.

Think about this in the frame of a family situation.  If something disappointing
happens in my family and I do the second method, my wife and daughter won't be
as enthusiastic in making sure the situation doesn't happen again.  They're just
going to be pissed off at me for placing blame and saying, "It's not my
problem." If I do the first situation, regardless of who's to blame (the person
knows who they are, placing blame doesn't help), we all rally around finding a
solution together and build our family stronger.

The second method is easy.  The first is hard.  There's a reason for that: the
second method is crap.  Things in life that are easy are generally crap.  Things
in life that take some work generally are the best ones, like raising kids,
having relationships, building a career, and helping others.
