I've removed Google AdWords from my blog and RSS feed.  So not worth it to have ads.  I've not yet made enough in ad impressions to get paid by Google and I've had ads up for almost 6 months.<br /><br />For those of you using AdBlock, you shouldn't notice any difference.  And yes, there were quite a few visitors blocking ads.  For those of you not using AdBlock, the blog should load a little faster and there won't be any more ads.<br /><br />Enjoy!</div>
