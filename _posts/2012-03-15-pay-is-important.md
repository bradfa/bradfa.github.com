Pay is important, but only to a certain extent.  Once you cross the barrier
for pay where it's "enough," the value more adds pales in comparison to the
dollar amount.  But until that "enough" point is reached, pay can be very
important.

Lots of people write about this topic, I'm certainly not the first.  That's my
disclaimer.

If you find out that the guy with 20 years less experience is getting paid
even close to your salary, that's going to ruin your day.  If you find that
out when you're frustrated, bad things will almost certainly go through your
mind.
