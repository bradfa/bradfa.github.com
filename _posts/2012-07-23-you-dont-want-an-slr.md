You probably don't want to buy an [SLR][1] camera. 
What you should be buying is a pocketable high quality point-and-shoot camera.

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera

Here's why:

**SLRs are big and bulky.**

You can't take it everywhere with you and so you'll
take pictures less often with an SLR than you would with a pocketable
point-and-shoot.  There are situations where you just can't take an SLR,
especially if you have kids or are travelling with other luggage, where you can
take a pocketable point-and-shoot.  Buy a high quality point-and-shoot and
you'll take pictures in more locations of more things.

**SLRs are expensive.**

The entry level SLR cameras start around $500 for a kit with a crap lens.
If you're really getting the most out of your SLR, you'll want better glass
(lenses), especially if you shoot low light, since most kit lenses are very
very slow (f-stop wise).  Good lenses cost good money, prepare to spend more on
lenses than on your camera (also, buy used, lenses don't get much better over
time and 5 year old tech is pretty much the same as today's tech except for the
image stabilization).

But if you want to really shoot like a pro, don't buy the entry level SLR, you
should spend more and get an upper level consumer or low level pro model.
That'll set you back even more, expect to spend a grand for really good quality
stuff.

Then, you'll need a bag, cause you can't risk damaging your expensive camera.
And with that spare lens you bought, you now have more than one thing to carry,
and it's kind of big.

And now that you have a bag and a spare lens, you have to consciously pack it
along (see point 1).  You're not going to want to take it with you everywhere
you go (I'm not going to take pictures at the fancy dinner restaurant, right? I
don't *need* to take the SLR this evening).  Now, you're going to miss shots.

**High-end point-and-shoots take really good pictures**

Until you're limited by the camera, which will require you to apply some photo
taking skills (which most people don't have and don't care to develop), an SLR
won't allow you to take better photos than a high quality point-and-shoot.  And
the high end point-and-shoots have the same sensors and (sometimes) faster
glass than the low end SLRs.  Many point-and-shoots have full (or almost full)
manual modes, do macro down to 1 inch focus, and can run > 1 minute exposures.
Some even have hot-shoes for external flashes.  Many now come with f2 or faster
lenses (that's really good!).

You can do a hell of a lot with a high quality point-and-shoot.  And it'll fit
in your pocket.  So, you'll take it to that fancy restaurant, and you'll take
pictures there, too.

**The best camera for the job is the one you have with you!**

The iPhone has a good camera, for a phone.  But, even $200 point-and-shoots will put
it to shame.

So, if you're out, and you don't have your SLR, use your iPhone.  But the low
light performance will suck, and you probably won't be able to get good 8x10
inch prints without noticeable grain.

If you had your pocketable point-and-shoot, you'd get good pictures.

**Conclusion**

It really all comes down to money and taking more pictures.  Taking more
pictures, or having the opportunity to, means having a camera with you more
often.

Buy the [$350 point-and-shoot][2].  Put it in your pocket when you go places.  Take
pictures.  Job done.

Or, spend > $1k on an SLR, buy a bag, and lug it around.  I hear those fanny
pack bags are nice...

**Addendum**

Of course, if you're a photo journalist, taking a photography course, or are
really into one or two specific types of photography (landscapes, night shots,
wildlife, sports, etc) an SLR probably is the right camera.  But if you're
doing these things, you probably already own a nice camera, a bunch of lenses,
and you're heavily invested in going on trips with your SLR for the main
purpose of taking the pictures you like to take.

Most people aren't like this.

I used to be (back when film was cool and Kodak made profits), but now I just
want to take pictures and not think about it...  So do 95% of people out there.
And for those people (and quite a few of the "already own an SLR" people), a
really nice piont-and-shoot will get the job done.
