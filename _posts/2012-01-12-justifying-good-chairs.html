<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/07/investing-in-a-quality-programming-chair.html">Good chairs</a> aren't cheap.  We're talking $800 for a high quality, new, warrantied, chair from a good supplier like <a href="http://www.steelcase.com">Steelcase</a> or <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/">Herman Miller</a>.<br /><br />But those same chairs, in great condition, on the used market generally can be had for $400 to $500.  $400 isn't that expensive for a chair when you think about it.<br /><br />Let's assume a quality engineer costs $100,000 per year (pay, benefits, taxes, and insurance) for a business.  With 260 working days in a year (5 days per week, 52 weeks per year), that's $385 per day that the business is paying for the engineer's time.<br /><br />What does that mean for chairs?  It means that over the course of a 3 year span where a quality engineer works for you, it's cheaper to buy a $400 chair than it is to have that engineer miss <b>1/3 of one day of work</b> (that's 3 hours) per year.<br /><br />Or think of it this way, if having a good $400 chair makes your engineer 0.13% more efficient over 3 years, the chair pays for itself.  That's <b>3 minutes</b> more output <b>per week!</b>  <b>3 minutes!</b><br /><br />Or, brand new $800 chairs mean you need to get 6 minutes more work out of your 3 year engineer per week.  Still not crazy, just over 1 minute per day more work to break even.</div>
