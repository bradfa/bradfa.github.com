I have just finished (in this order) reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307463745?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bradford07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307463745">Rework</a> by Hansson and Fried, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594488843?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bradford07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594488843">Drive</a> by Dan Pink, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843162?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bradford07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591843162">Linchpin</a> by Seth Godin.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Rework.&nbsp; It is part of the reason I started this blog and want to get back into Linux.&nbsp; I'm not yet sure how I can make decent money off Linux with the skills I have, but I'm excited to try.&nbsp; And Rework, combined with reading a lot of things written by VCs, has given me a good feel for the tech new business starting landscape.&nbsp; Mostly that there's no one right way to start up a business, but without trying, it won't work.<br /><br />Drive was also very good, but a little more wordy than Rework.&nbsp; Also, before I read Drive, I watched some of Dan Pink's presentations on YouTube.&nbsp; Basically what he says in the book is what he says in the videos online.&nbsp; That was somewhat a letdown for me, but still worth reading the book as he is able to go into more detail of examples.<br /><br />Linchpin kind of let me down.&nbsp; It's very wordy for the message.&nbsp; I liked the message, but it just takes too long for Godin to get it across.&nbsp; A book with half the amount of pages would have gotten the message across just as well, if not better.<br /><br />I'd recommend both Rework and Drive.&nbsp; Especially if you're at a job where you feel something is missing but you're not sure what.&nbsp; You're talented and capable but you're not reaching your full potential at work, these two books will talk to you.&nbsp; Linchpin will talk to you too, but it's annoying and less inspirational.</div>
